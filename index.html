<html>
<head>
	<title>The title goes here, it describes your web page</title>
	To include inline styles withi the app add them here using the style tags

<body>
All the code for the application goes here

the body has many tags from p,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5, div, span, blockquote etc
lets aadd a heading to our webpage

then lets add a paragraph to our webpage

after the paragraph we can add alist of things we coders love doing


lists can be either ordered or unordered
 lets create an ordered list using ol tag, they can come in between aparagraphs as the develpoer wishes, lets put it right in the paragraph,
 each item in the list is denoted by a li tag

 to make the page relevant lets add an image. 
 Our file index.html exists in the folder html_tutorial
 inside the folder lets add a folder called images and add an images there
 inside the folder we will add an image. I will use this project`s folder structure

 in the images folder we now have a file called directory.png, lets display it in our web page

 we we will use the img tag
the src attribute defines where the image is stored relative to this file
the alt attribut defines what should be displayed if the image is ot found

css can be used to scale the image or use the height and width
